Stuff I did during my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota. This is a work in progress, and I will add and modify this repository as needed, as this is my first attempt to host a personal github repo.

DISCLAIMER: Any and all code contained in this repository is intended for non-profit, educational reference only. You may use this code in accordance with the terms of any licenses contained therein. Students choosing to use any portion of this code for coursework do so at their own risk. Some academic professors consider using code retrieved from the Internet for assignments to be cheating; students who cheat are routinely caught all the time and they get 0s, Fs, and/or even expulsions. Students, you alone are responsible for knowing and complying with your school's academic integrity and plagiarism policies, along with any rules the professor lays out with regard to coursework. It is always best to do the work yourself and come up with your own solutions; that way, you do not have to worry about getting in trouble for plagiarism.
