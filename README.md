Stuff I did during my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota. This is a work in progress, and I will add and modify this repository as needed, as this is my first attempt to host a personal github repo.

DISCLAIMER: Any and all code contained in this repository is intended for reference only. I am not responsible for the consequences of your choosing to use any portion of my code for your coursework. Professors can, will, and do hand out Fs to students who get caught cheating (and many of them even get expelled). You alone are responsible for knowing and complying with your school's academic integrity and plagiarism policies, along with any rules the professor lays out with regard to coursework. It is always best to do the work yourself and come up with your own solutions.
