Group project for CSCI 5221. This program is a PDF split-and-merge tool with backend support. Users can merge or split PDF files, save the output to an account on a backend server linked with Google login API (or temporarily store the files on the server for 24 hours, if the user does not wish to create an account) and then download the files either as an archive, individual files, or direct URIs. Client written in Java/Android SDK, and the server program (found elsewhere) is in PHP with Apache and PDFBox integration.
